**Project summary**

Mirai is a case study in decentralized character creation, exploring how AI-powered virtual humans can evolve through meme culture, social platforms, and community-driven IP. It represents a new frontier for virtual identity, where digital beings are not only content creators but autonomous entities with long-term value and potential across Web3 ecosystems.

Mirai is made possible by the collaboration between Aww Inc., who leads her creation, design, and storytelling, and Holoworld AI, who brings her to life as an AI agent with blockchain integration. Together, we're building a new kind of character IP: co-created with the world, powered by AI, and owned onchain.

**About the team**

Aww Inc. is a pioneering virtual human AI company based in Japan, specializing in the development and production of hyperrealistic virtual beings through cutting-edge virtual technology. Aww Inc. is behind globally recognized virtual humans such as imma, plusticboy, and Ria. In addition to virtual human production, Aww Inc. leads research and development in core virtual human technologies and actively expands its business into the metaverse, virtual fashion, and cross-industry collaborations.

At the forefront of Aww Inc.’s creations is imma, Japan’s first virtual model and a globally celebrated cultural icon. Instantly recognizable by her signature pink bob, imma blurs the line between real and virtual in a way that challenges perceptions of identity in the digital age. Often mistaken for a real person, imma has become a symbol of authenticity in an era of digitally constructed reality. Her presence is both innovative and influential—she was named Asia’s No.1 influential virtual human, selected as one of Forbes Women of the Year 2020 (Poland), and featured in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics Closing Ceremony. Most recently, imma was appointed as the official MC of the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025, the next World Expo, further solidifying her role as a cultural bridge between technology and humanity on the global stage.

imma has collaborated with some of the world’s most influential brands, including Amazon, IKEA, Coach, Puma, Calvin Klein, and SK-II, proving her versatility across fashion, beauty, tech, and lifestyle sectors.

Aww Inc. has also entered a technical partnership with NVIDIA, integrating real-time AI solutions such as Audio2Face to enhance the realism and scalability of its virtual human production. Additionally, Aww Inc. was selected to receive the prestigious Epic Games MetaHuman Creator Grant, in recognition of its innovation in digital character storytelling.

Through the integration of art, technology, and human connection, Aww Inc. is a global leader in redefining boundaries of identity, media, and the future of communication using virtual humans.
