**What is SKYAI?**

SKYAI is a data infrastructure built for LLMs. It connects blockchain data with AI agents through an extended Model Context Protocol, enabling scalable, real-time access to multi-chain data. It is for builders, agents, and data providers.

**Extended MCP by SKYAI**

SKYAI will propose an extended MCP (Model Context Protocol) and will create a multi-chain data service specifically for LLM usage scenarios.

**Backward Compatibility + New Client**

This extended MCP is compatible with ordinary MCP clients, but SKYAI will release a dedicated MCP client to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the extended protocol.

**Massive Multi-Chain Data Support**

SKYAI now supports aggregated data sets from BSC and Solana, which exceed 10B rows.

**On-Chain Data Liquidity & Marketplace**

SKYAI has also proposed the concept of data liquidity and will launch the MCP marketplace to create an on-chain data economy ecosystem.
