**Project summary**

**1 Request a token launch**
Tag or DM @GitFish on X with a GitHub repo link — we'll manually review and launch tokens. Permissionless launch coming soon.

**2 Bid in token auction**
10M tokens are minted at launch. ⅓ supply is sold via a 3-day auction. It's a fair launch, so all bidders get the same token price.

**3 Trade after auction ends**
SOL raised from the auction, along with another ⅓ token supply, is migrated to a Raydium pool to enable token trading.

**4 Verify ownership**
GitHub repo owners can verify their account to:
(1) claim Raydium swap fees
(2) coming soon — vest the remaining ⅓ vesting token supply, reserved for future project development.

**On a mission to fund every open source project. Tokenize and trade GitHub repos**
