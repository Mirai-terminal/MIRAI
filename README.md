**The Foundational Infrastructure Ushering in a New Era of “Liquidity Co-Building” on BNB Chain**

UpTop is a decentralized liquidity protocol built on BNB Chain, designed to empower projects with community-driven LP (liquidity pool) building capabilities. It replaces manual market-making with automated protocols and replaces VC control with community participation—initiating a new paradigm of liquidity infrastructure.

**UpTop's Role & Vision**
UpTop is not a project, but a liquidity infrastructure platform that empowers all BNB Chain projects.

It's not a token-launching tool or meme factory, but a foundational engine for every Meme, SocialFi, and DeFi project to gain deep, community-built, and sustainable liquidity from Day 1.

Just as Pump.fun shaped the liquidity meta on Solana, UpTop aims to pioneer the "Liquidity Co-Building" track on BNB Chain.
